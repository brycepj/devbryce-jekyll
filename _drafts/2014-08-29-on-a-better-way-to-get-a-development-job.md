If you're a software developer looking for your second job, don't worry -- you'll get plenty of offers. That's why this post isn't about how to get *a* second job, it's about how to get a *great* second job. What is a great second job?

My story: 




Write down what you liked about your first job
Write down what you didn't like about your second job
Come up with questions that help you determine -- where the person can't lie
Forget about not about money
Talk to people, do it via a connection
Ask for 30% more than you're making now
Don't sacrifice on anything that matters to you
Focus on engineering best practices -- find somewhere that's going to teach you engineering, not just writing code
Stop filling out online resumes
Be honest about your shortcomings
Work on open-source projects
