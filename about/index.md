I'm a software developer at a pretty rad company, [Maternity Neighborhood](http://maternityneighborhood.com/), where I work mostly on front-end web things.

In my spare time I attend the [Central Virginia JavaScript Enthusiasts](http://www.meetup.com/Central-Virginia-Javascript-Enthusiasts-CVJSE/) meetup, hang out with my wife and our two cats, Ruby and Steve, and seek out really good pizza restaurants.

This blog is nothing too serious -- it's where I share what I'm learning and host side projects. If you want to get a hold of me, I'm on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_brycepj), [linkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brycepj/), and [email](mailto:brycepj@gmail.com).
