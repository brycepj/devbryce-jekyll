I'm a front-end developer at a company in Charlottesville, VA that does data visualization web apps for public schools. I used to be a copywriter, and I still take on a few freelance writing jobs here and there.

This blog is nothing too serious. I use it to share what I'm learning and host side projects. If you want to get a hold of me, I'm on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_brycepj), [linkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brycepj/), and [email](mailto:brycepj@gmail.com).
