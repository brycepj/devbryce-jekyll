I'm a software developer at a pretty rad company, [Maternity Neighborhood](http://maternityneighborhood.com/), where I work mostly on front-end web things.

In my spare time I attend the [Central Virginia JavaScript Enthusiasts](http://www.meetup.com/Central-Virginia-Javascript-Enthusiasts-CVJSE/) meetup, hang out with my wife and our two cats, Ruby and Steve, and seek out really good pizza restaurants.

This blog is nothing too serious -- it's where I share what I'm learning and host side projects. If you want to get a hold of me, I'm on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_brycepj), [linkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brycepj/), and [email](mailto:brycepj@gmail.com).

## projects

- [timeline insights](https://github.com/brycepj/timeline-insights) - an open-source JavaScript library for extracting insights from the Twitter API's user_timeline client-side.
- [flexbox in 5 minutes](http://devbryce.com/flexbox) - an interactive tour of all the major features of the new CSS property: flexbox. Built using Knockout.js.
- [My entry](http://devbryce.com/css-off) to the 2013 CSS-OFF. Last updated - Oct 2013
