I'm a front-end developer for a company that does data visualization web apps for clients in public education. I used to be a copywriter, and I still take on a few freelance writing jobs here and there.

This blog is nothing too serious. I just use it to share what I'm learning and host the occassional side project. If you want to get a hold of me, I'm on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_brycepj), [linkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brycepj/), and [email](mailto:brycepj@gmail.com).  


## projects

- [Flexbox Playground](http://devbryce.com/flexbox) - an app I'm building with Knockout.JS to help people get familiar with the new layout property: flexbox. (in progress)
- [My entry](http://devbryce.com/css-off) to the 2013 CSS-OFF
