I'm a front-end developer for a company in Charlottesville, VA, where I work on data visualization applications for clients in public education. I used to be a copywriter, so I still take on a few freelance writing jobs here and there. If you want to get a hold of me, I'm on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_brycepj), [linkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brycepj/), and [email](mailto:brycepj@gmail.com). So take your pick.
