snippet: Typescript isn't very well documented yet, but the official spec isn't all we've got. Here's where I'd recommend you get started.

TypeScript is an incredibly helpful tool for helping you write clean, modular JavaScript. But it's young, and [the spec](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf) is the only official resource we have from Microsoft. 

Instead of trying to learn by plowing through it (which I tried to do), here are a two resources I really liked. 

## The TypeScript Playground 

The official site for TypeScript is actually really well done. [The Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/) allows you to see various implementations of TypeScript adjacent to the JavaScript it compiles to. Since it's all in a live code editor, you can play around with the code as much as you like, until you're familiar with it. 

## TypeScript Fundamentals by John Papa 

This [4-part series](http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost1/) of blog posts is what really opened my eyes to what I could do with TypeScript. Go through each post slowly, and by the end you'll know the important parts. 

For someone who's just coming to TypeScript, you need a guided tour through the most important features of the language (if we're calling it a language), not a 130-page spec of every nook and cranny. That's for later. 

*I'll update this list regularly as I come across other helpful resources.*
