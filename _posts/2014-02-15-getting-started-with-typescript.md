snippet: Typescript isn't very well documented yet, but the official spec isn't all we've got. Here's where I'd recommend you get started.

TypeScript is a helpful tool if you're trying to write clean, modular JavaScript. But it's young, and [the spec](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf) is the only official documentation we have from the creators (Microsoft). 

Instead of trying to learn by plowing through the spec (which I tried to do), here are three resources I found much more instructive. 

## TypeScript Fundamentals by John Papa 

For someone who's just coming to TypeScript, you need a guided tour through the most important features of the language, not a 130-page spec of every nook and cranny. That's for later. 

This [4-part series](http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost1/) of blog posts is what really opened my eyes to what I could do with TypeScript. Go through each post slowly, and by the end you'll know what the important parts do. 

## TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers (an ebook) by Steve Fenton

If you're looking for a deeper dive into TypeScript than the blog series above gives you, I can't recommend [TypeScript for JavaScript Progammers](https://leanpub.com/typescriptbook) highly enough, which Steve Fenton has published on LeanPub. I like it because it's extremely well-written and thorough, but terse and condensed enough that you can crank through it in a couple of hours. It reminds me a lot of Crockford's 'JavaScript: The Good Parts" in that way. 

And since it's on LeanPub, you can pay whatever you want for it ($0.99 minimum) and get it in any format (PDF, mobi, and epub). I'd say it's an outstanding value overall and worth every penny. 

## The TypeScript Playground 

The official site for TypeScript is actually really well done. [The Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/) allows you to see various implementations of TypeScript adjacent to the JavaScript it compiles to. Since it's all in a live code editor, you can play around with the code as much as you like, until you're familiar with it. 

*I'll update this list regularly as I come across other helpful resources.*
