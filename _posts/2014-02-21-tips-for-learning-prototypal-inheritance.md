snippet: Prototypal inheritance is tricky, but any serious JavaScript developer needs to know it inside and out. Here's a pretty diverse set of resources that helped me learn the basics.

Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is a beast. When I started trying to learn it, I had several months of experience with JavaScript under my belt. Even so, it took weeks of digging through the internet and practicing a ton to really get the hang of it. 

That's a long time. Hopefully, the (fairly eclectic) list I've put together here will help you pick it up and start using it more quickly than I did. 

## Get acquainted with TypeScript

There's a good chance you've never heard of [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org). In many ways, it is to JavaScript what SASS is to CSS: a pre-processed language that accepts pure JS while also giving you a lot of shorthand expressions and tools to modularize your code. 

It helped me learn prototypal inheritance because almost all of the shorthand syntax (like Classes and Constructors) in TypeScript highlight the important features of prototypal inheritance. I'm still not great with TypeScript, but it really helped me see the bigger picture. 

You can play around on the playground I linked to above, or check out this [4-part series](http://www.johnpapa.net/typescriptpost1/) by John Papa, which I highly recommend. 

## Read guides written by really smart people:

There are roughly 400,000 articles out there about prototypal inheritance, only a few of which are actually helpful. Here are four that I loved. I recommend reading them slowly--make sure you understand what's happening in each code sample before moving on to the next one.

## Listen to really smart people talk about it

For some reason, podcasts really help me solidify my understanding of concepts I'm hazy on. For Prototypal inheritance, I'd recommend the [JavaScript Jabber conversation about Objects](http://javascriptjabber.com/005-jsj-javascript-objects/), as well as [this one](http://javascriptjabber.com/026-jsj-code-organization-and-reuse/) about code organization and reuse. Both are definitely more in-depth than the articles I've listed above, but they're a good way to get a feel for how all the concepts fit together.
