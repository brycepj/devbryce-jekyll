You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## Set up a VPS with SSH: A graphical guide for the faint of heart
 
Who I am, who you are.

Disclaimer: I know nothing about Windows and I don't care to. So if that's you, this probably isn't for you. I'm familiar with OSX and Linux (Ubuntu), so that's what this tutorial is geared toward. 

The graphical story...servers, computers, and SSH.

Setting Up a VPS, start to finish. 

- Do lots of research to cover it all
- Start with buying a domain and buying the service

### Buy your domain

Sign up for a VPS
- Difference between VPS and a regular server

### Set Up SSH on your computer
